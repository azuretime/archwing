# Description
Develop a Dapp that manages insurance for travelers. Through a web front-end, a traveler should be able to:


- Buy insurance submitting legitimate ticket evidence. Static prices are SGD$30 or 150 loyalty points when round-trip tickets, SGD$20 or 100 points when one-way ticket.
- Payment could be made by integration in-time with Metamask or Mist Ethereum wallet using tokens.
- Loyalty program. Every time a traveler buys insurance, he/she gets points: 30 points for a round trip ticket insurance, and 10 points otherwise.
- Claim money back under following rules. Only the traveler triggers this action.
  - If flight only delayed, the traveler gets SGD$200
  - If flights canceled, the traveler receives SDG$5,000
  - If a traveler got money when the flight was delayed but it turns out to be canceled, he/she can get the remainder SGD$4,800.

The Dapp should perform the following tasks automatically.

- Get the correct rate or conversion SGD/ETH for calculating the correct value to pay in Ethers at the transaction moment.
- Read, analyze, and extract tickets data. Consider reading PDF or images with QR codes
- Request information about flights existence and status to a legitimate data source (e.g., Changi Airport) through a contract to contract communication.

# Requirements
- Node v11
- Python v2
- NPM v6
- Metamask
- Ganache GUI (set port to 8545)
- Truffle - `npm install truffle -g`

# Setup
```sh
nvm use 11
npm install
truffle compile
truffle migrate
npm run start
```

After starting up the server:
- Connect to the local network with Metamask. Use the mnemoic provided by Ganache.
- Approve the connection
- Refresh localhost:3000

# Testing
```sh
truffle test # for contract testing
npm run test # for React testing
```

# Building
```sh
npm run build
```
